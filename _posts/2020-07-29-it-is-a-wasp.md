Okay maybe it's a bee. But it looks gross and very wasp-like...

What a trip. Jennifer tried killed her parents?!?

Sorry your knee got so banged up, sorry about your neck being omega whiplashed as well :(

Was it fun at least?!?!? 

Double sorry i'm not a very good teacher...

But i mean if you ask me, i had fun. Hehe, any sort of 'living together' with you experience is always fun. It makes me feel like it's just you and me against the world. Is that lame? Heh. Ops.

This whole, 'go with pangna' idea I had didn't really end up being as good as I thought. You also picked up snowboarding faster than the average person too (perhaps due to a great teacher..?)

Hopefully these massages will help your neck and hopefully you're not too turned off snowboarding...I really enjoyed the trip but to be fair i'll enjoy anywhere with you. Yes that's right. Even EUROPE..! Jokes aside, a Thank you for everything you've done is in order. 

The planning, cooking, patience with me and efforts over the last 4 days made me feel really special. 

Thank you bebs, love you.
