Hiya babes,

Sorry there's been a card drought for a while. I know how much you like them (even though i don't know EXACTLY why!!!). I highkey hope these series of stupid little blog posts serve as a 'making up for card shortages' type of vibe. I'll still hopefully write you a nice physical one come anniversary day but just idk typing stuff to psyche myself up?

Anyway, I'm glad you reminded me and i'm semi double glad that I didn't get angry at you for reminding me. There is a hidden card in the sheets of 250 GSM paper I gave you that you still haven't found. Heh. Are you going to go look for it now that you've read this? Multi-phased card delivery ambush tactics?

Heh. Heh. Heh. Anyawy! Love you! Mwah! Make sure you leave a like, subscribe, follow to keep up to date with the next posts!!!
