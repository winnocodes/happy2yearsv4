Good evening.

I think you may have guessed why the hiatus in posts over the last few days :(

This is going to sound so fucked up but the amount of joy and happiness i feel when we STOP fighting and make up is pretty surreal.

It feels like i've been reborn...

Anyway.

An apology is in order. I want to apologise for making you upset. I know you think my method of 'havings things your way' and 'priorisiting you first' may actually be self-destructive to our relationship. I get. And i also get you trying to take on feedback (if i ever give you any) so that something can change and we don't constantly have near break up fights. 

I honestly do get it, I just need to try harder and remind myself in tough times, not of all the short comings and issues we have in the relationship but instead the opposite. All snoozes in the morning, all the 'same-idea-i-was-going-to-say-that-dahhhhhh' jokes, all the love and cherished moments we've spent together. When I think of those times, I feel so stupid for ever getting so emotional and angry - but alas idk. I just suck at times.

I'm planning on giving ya the blog and everything before I leave for the slopes. I sort of just realised it will be in reverse chronological order so uh.. Idk. TIMELINE SURPIRSE! EVERYTHINGS EVERYWHERE! I LOVE YOU!!!
