Ello,

I think i've already told you this but when we were tripping out to Kanye West Blame Game there was something weirdly romantically peaceful about that moment. Even though you were probably tripping to the max. Heh.

I just remember looking at you, thinking about what we went through the last two hours, all the crazy stuff you did and said and i was like heh. I love this girl.

Shout out to Kanye woooh. Oh but also shout out to you for showing me this song.
