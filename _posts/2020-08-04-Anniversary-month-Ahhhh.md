Howdy.

We are approaching anniversary day! Omg!

I still need to obtain so much shtuff. I don't even know if i'll be able to. I also don't even know if you'll like it. AHHHH.

Honestly bebs, you've become a full fledged footy girl now. I don't remember a weekened where we haven't watched at least one game... I mean that's nothing to be proud of (or is it..) Is the next step for you to play tag...? 

Out of all the gifts I want to get you, i hope this blog post tops it all off. I mean like, the other gifts are obtained with like.. money. This was sort of tough, much research, many writings, many thoughts. Well I mean at the end of the day if you don't like it or if you don't read every post that's still okay! MAYBE YOU'LL LIKE THE PILLOW CASE MORE? OR THE GOGGLES?

Just so you know, besides before we call at night. I think about you a lot throughout the day. I mean to the point where I notice i catch myself thinking hmm. I wonder how Helen is at work, or what she's up to at home or if she's eaten lunch yet. I guess it might not seem like a big deal to you but I sort of find it nice. I wish i was less selfish and it was more than just 'thinking' about you you know. Sometimes that's not really enough but I like how it's organic? Like, it's not like - reminder - 12pm - think about what Belen's having for lunch. I just notice how sort of my concern and thoughts of you are a natural thing now. 

Sorry that's not me trying to sound romantic. Just pure analytical reasoning.. Me trying to be sound romantic would've been when i kept guard on the beach of Waikiki while you slept in all your clothes because we had just landed. Boy we were tired. LOL.
