Ello bebs,

I mean it's supposed to be a surprise blog post full of happy stuff but when talking about us, love, our relationship I feel like i gotta address the fighting...

You once asked me if we're doomed to just fight for the rest of our lives. I hope not. I really do. But the whole 'thinking i'm baked' and the getting angry at you while swimming. I feel like they're all cases of shitty annoying hiccups that get blown out of proportion. Like I think back about them and always wonder why and how I get so angry or the argument got so heated. 

I'm sorry that a lot of it just has to do with me. And i'm sorry you have to cry to get your message across. 

I love you with all my heart and although I suck, I'm going to keep trying and hope to make you proud. Weird thing to say i guess but that's the truth of it.

Love you always.

Mr Winno.
