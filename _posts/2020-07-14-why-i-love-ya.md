Ello, 

It is i. Another blog post. The big question today is - Why I Love you?

I'll be doing these intermittently until the 25th,26th,27th (but really 27th) of August just to prove that,

Number 1 - It's a difficult question to answer

and

Number 2 - It'll probably change based on how I feel and ma mood.

and 

Number 3 - Here is a photo because i want to flex i learnt how to code em in!

![belenphoto2]({{ "/img/bestbelenface.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Okay, so for the longest time and from when we first met. (Btw all this should be no news to you) I thought you were so different and unique and sort of like me. We didn't share like common 'interests' and stuff but just the way you sort of lived through life i found very unique and attractive and lovey. 

But still doesn't really define EXACTLY why i love you and i'm not motivated to really find out why. The gist of it is, when i'm with you, i'm very happy. When i'm without you, i hope it doesn't stay that way for too long and that i'll be able to be with you soon.
