I think if you really FORCE me to try to define it - the answer is - I just like being around you. I wouldn't be able to spend weekends, days, hours with someone i don't truly love.

I mean I could spend hours together with my family, but like it's not the same type of 'time spent' together. You know? 

I do make it my mission to try not to be on my phone TOO much when i'm with you, or especially when you're trying to tell me something. I remember back to a night like weeks ago where you slept over and we just chatted in bed in the darkness before sleeping. There was something so tranquil and nice (for the lack of a better word) about that. 

One of the best feelings i've ever discovered is waking up in the morning with you next to me and you semi-sleepily hug me and strap me in with your arm across my body. I mean you're basically asleep so can you really say you're doing it intentionally? Hehe, regardless - I feel so at ease in your arms for those short moments. 

I mean that's not to say it's the REASON why i love you. It goes deeper than that. But just figured i'd be honest and let you know what it's like on the receiving end. 

The question shall still not have an adequate answer. Hey, why don't we like... Spend the rest of our lives together trying to figure out why we love one another? I wouldn't mind.

Was that cheesy? Yeah whats up. I got milk. I can make cheese.

Love ya!
