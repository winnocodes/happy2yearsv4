Dear Helen,

I shall now start to learn indo! So i can semi understand what your parents are talking about and make em more comfortable around me and that.
After you see this in like 5 days or so it will be converted to a language learning blog! Ahhh!
Anyway - Love you. Thanks for inviting me to the birthday dinner. Double thanks for eating the raw fish sushi.

Also quick update on the status of da gifts! Lemon Meringue cheesecake combo recipe acquired. The recipe is fukn HARD! I'm also not going to listen to my own advice and do a first try attempt and also give it to ya. Crikey.

Also need to go steal a street sign.

Also need to get silk pillow cases - in pink!

I've got this idea to like hide it in your house somewhere? And then when i'm at the snows and on the 27th i do the good ol hide and seeko with you and then bam surprise. Gift! Yes infact I will do that. 

By the time you're reading this pls check the room next to your laundry room - under some clothes or something.
