Okay this update took straight up 3 hours to get the coding right to get your cheesy smile here. FINALY.

Anyway, do you remember this day? It was when we went to a cafe near Blakehurst? I don't know if I've told you this but i despise travelling! I also despise cafes! But when I see this photo and how i asked you to smile and how cute you look it makes me not hate it so much.
