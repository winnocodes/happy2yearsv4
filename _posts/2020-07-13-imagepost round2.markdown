Anyway, do you remember this day? It was when we went to a cafe near Blakehurst? I don't know if I've told you this but i used to hate travelling far! I also aint the biggest fan of cafes! But!!!! 

When I see this photo and how i asked you to smile and how cute you look it makes me not hate it so much :)
