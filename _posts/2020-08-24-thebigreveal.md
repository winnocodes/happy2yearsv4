Good afternoon M'lady.

Ya didn't think the shitty cards were all I had right?!!?

Okay but I have nothing more after this, there's no like, tier 4 super uhm omega card. This blog post is the last frontier.

I mean it's like, every post is a card? But like not really at the same time?

I dont know if you'll like it. You might even think it's lame. AHH I'm having all these second thoughts. 

It's literally 1:30 as i write this while you do your posty post thing with the shoes. What's for lunch btw? I'm starvin.

Anyway, have fun reading through all the posts, they're all dated.

Just wanted to remind you just how much I love you and cherished the last two years we've spent together. Definitely many downs but also many ups. I'm hoping to swing the favour towards more ups than downs...

I'll admit that I haven't been the best to you and for you throughout the two years and I suppose it's my own selfish desire to want to continue to be with you and prove myself. I just want you to be the most happy and I do believe that I can play a part in your life. I just need to stop being so shite!

I did have other grand plans like the pillow cases, cheesecake, fake hand written cards, street sign. Idk all these weird gifts to try and speak your love language - oooh la la ~ but half of them failed and the other half didn't even end up as good as i wanted..

REGARDLESS, NO MORE LOSER TALK. I love you with all my heart. Truly. I've never regretted a single moment with you. Every second spent together was a moment i enjoyed. Yes yes I know, easy to say in a blogpost love letter. BUT IT'S TRUE!

I hope we have many more anniversaries to come and I hope i can keep on surprising you - in the good ways. 

Happy two years baby. I love you always.
