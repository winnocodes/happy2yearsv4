Babe! You're gnarly!!

Last minute weekend snow trip? With Pangna and Wendy? I mean I sort of encouraged it because i thought it'll be more fun for you to learn with someone else that's new and you actually agreed for us to go?!!? 

I'm gonna try get shit sorted for the trip to make it as ay okay as possible. Borrow lift pass, snow gear, roof racks? Food + holiday planning? Sheesh. None are really my strong suit but i shall try.

I'm actually really glad that you said yes (to the snow trip, not marriage), I feel like you're really trying hard to 'do the same stuff' that I do. Even though just your support and permission to go shred for a few days is good enough, to actually do it with me too? You're too much babe. srsly.

You honestly spoil me. I love you so much.
