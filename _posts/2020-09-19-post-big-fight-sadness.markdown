Dear Helen,

It is 1:24AM 19/08/2020. I called you a little late because I showered late and was kept playing games longer than i expected.

We talked about some stuff - nothing really important, a netflix series, Anime, Snowboard purchasing. Then you got upset at me because I tried to telling you a joke and decided half-way through that I didn't want to finish it. You kept asking for me to tell you but I didn't want to - It led to you telling me that I should care more about your feelings.

You called me petty, think my reasons for feeling and doing certain things aren't good enough and you probably wish I wasn't as selfish as I am.

I don't know if you'll even get to read this. There's so much uncertainty in us. I used to not think that way, I used to think that despite all the fights we'd stay together, work through it and become a better couple for each other. I don't think that anymore.

I try to think that at any given moment you can leave me, never be apart of my life ever again and it brings me overwhelming sadness.

Tonight I think deeply about whether I'm good enough for you. Whether my love for you is a strong enough excuse for us to stay together. Whether you're truly happy being in a relationship with me. I think I said said something like "I'll never break up with you" and I was a firm believer in that. Now though, I should really change it "I'll do whatever I can to try to make you happiest".

For me, that means a lot of change. Change in perspective, change in communication - verbal and non-verbal, change in what I should try to prioritise in my life. I hope to be able to make you happy; that's my end goal. I think about how deeply you're hurt, how you cried and how upset you are with me. I don't know if I'm right for you. 

Sorry I know this is supposed to be a gift celebrating our two years together but I don't think me telling you any of this has any value yet. 

It's during times like this I feel like you could be with someone a lot better than me. You wouldn't have to bear the pain of us continually fighting and me being too selfish. I just don't know what else to do besides document my thoughts as I think them. 

It is my hope that your belief in me is not wasted and that I can make you proud.

Til then and always,

Love Winno.
