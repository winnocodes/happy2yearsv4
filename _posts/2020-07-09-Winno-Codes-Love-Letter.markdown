Hiya babe,
toot toot toot, i'm coding!
And writing letters virtually to boot.
Amazing.
I mean i think you prefer hand written ones but this was like tough to learn and the layout and formatting are still trash. But still early days? I still have almost two months to whip up something gnarly.
I hope you like it - I mean it definitely tops no card and super expensive dinner from last year...

Anyway,

I just wanted to thank you very much for coming to see me when I broke my fukn back. Safe to say your company made me feel a lot better about recovery and not so down in the dumps. Even though you also raped me :(

Okay love you! Bye!
