Our first holiday of 2020 is coming up berry soon. Most of the jazz is sorted, lots of driving, very tired. Can't believe no butt pads. Dang shame.

Anyway, I shall try not to fight with ya this trip. I mean, i never 'TRY' to fight with you, but i'm going to try extra hard NOT TO. I think back to Hawaii and how I lowkey made it NOT A GOOD TIME at a lot of stages. I mean the 9923759km walk to the Okinawa centre festival was tough but not fight worthy :(

Speaking of Hawaii. Here is an image. They r quite hard to like 'put up'.

Here you're looking ridiculously cute in green with your gorgeous smile. heh. Did someone order a compliment sandwich? Yeah. Me. For you. Sup.

Okay no blog posts til we get back. Til then. Love you berry much. I shall now insert a berry photo. But it will be huge.
